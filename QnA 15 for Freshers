•	AWS Trusted Advisor: Use it for cost-saving recommendations on resource optimization.
•	Data Migration to Economical Services:
Example: If your organization uses expensive file-sharing services, migrate to more cost-effective AWS services like Amazon S3 or leverage AWS WorkDocs.
•	Instance Right-Sizing:
o	Analyze instance usage using AWS Cost Explorer and resize instances accordingly.
o	Consider Spot Instances for non-critical workloads and Savings Plans for long-term workloads.
•	Resource Tagging for Cost Analysis:
o	Apply tags to AWS resources to group costs by department or environment (production vs. staging).
aws ec2 create-tags --resources i-0abcd1234efgh5678 --tags Key=Environment,Value=Production
•	Idle Resource Management:
Automate the start/stop schedules for non-production instances using AWS Instance Scheduler.
