In Detail
Q1: How do you secure your DevOps pipeline, especially with secret management techniques?
A: In my DevSecOps projects, I embed security at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline. To secure secrets:
•	Repository Stage: I use Git hooks to detect sensitive information before committing code.
•	Build Stage: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) helps scan for vulnerabilities in static code.
•	Image Security: After building Docker images, I scan for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy.
•	Deployment: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) ensures secure runtime environments.
•	Post-Deployment: Continuous monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana helps detect and respond to security issues in real-time.
________________________________________
Q2: What is the difference between SAST and DAST?
A: SAST (Static Application Security Testing) analyzes source code for vulnerabilities before the application is deployed.
•	Example: Detecting unused imports in Python or identifying hard-coded secrets.
DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) scans the application in a running environment.
•	Example: Detecting open ports or vulnerabilities that can be exploited in a production environment, such as 404 errors.
________________________________________
Q3: Can you give an example of how you've automated infrastructure deployment using Ansible?
A: I used Ansible for configuration management after creating EC2 instances with Terraform.
•	Playbook Example: Installing Nginx on EC2 instances automatically.
•	Handlers: I used handlers to restart services whenever configuration changes were made.
________________________________________
Q4: What differentiates Ansible from other configuration management tools like Chef and Puppet?
A: Ansible is agentless and uses SSH for communication, making it lightweight and easy to use. Chef and Puppet require agents and master nodes, which add complexity but can be more powerful for large-scale environments.
________________________________________
Q5: What's the difference between a Pod and a Container in Kubernetes?
A: A container runs an application and its dependencies in isolation.
A pod is a higher-level abstraction in Kubernetes that can contain one or more containers.
•	Example: A pod running an NGINX server alongside a logging container.
________________________________________
Q6: Can you walk us through a Kubernetes deployment issue you resolved?
A: Sure, during a production deployment, the application pods kept restarting.
•	Root Cause: Insufficient memory allocation in the pod resource limits.
•	Solution: I adjusted the resource requests and limits in the YAML manifest and scaled up the nodes in the EKS cluster.
Scenario 1: Troubleshooting a Failed Kubernetes Pod
Q: A pod in your Kubernetes cluster is stuck in "CrashLoopBackOff" status. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?
A:
1.	Check Pod Logs:
kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous
Analyze the logs for errors such as missing environment variables or application-specific issues.
2.	Describe the Pod:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
Look for events related to image pulling, resource limits, or configuration errors.
3.	Common Solutions:
o	Verify environment variables are correctly set in the deployment spec.
o	Ensure the Docker image is available and accessible.
o	Increase resource requests or limits if OOMKilled errors are found.
o	Check for compatibility between the application and Kubernetes version.
4.	Best Practice: Use readiness and liveness probes to monitor pod health.
