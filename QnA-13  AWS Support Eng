Real-World Troubleshooting Scenarios
Q1: How do AWS Support Engineers troubleshoot Lambda issues?
Answer:
•	Use CloudWatch Logs for detailed execution analysis.
•	Check memory or timeout configurations and ensure IAM permissions are correct.
Real-World Scenario: A customer's Lambda function fails intermittently when fetching data from an S3 bucket. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Review CloudWatch Logs to identify error codes like AccessDenied.
2.	Confirm the Lambda execution role has the s3:GetObject permission.
3.	Verify the bucket policy allows access from the Lambda function’s ARN.
4.	Suggest enabling retries or increasing the function's timeout.

Q2: What are common RDS troubleshooting tasks?
Answer:
Handle connectivity issues, optimize query performance, and resolve backup failures.
Real-World Scenario: A customer’s RDS instance is unresponsive due to high CPU utilization. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Enable Performance Insights to identify high-load queries.
2.	Suggest adding proper indexing or optimizing queries.
3.	Scale the instance to a higher class if resource usage remains high.
________________________________________
Q3: How do you troubleshoot S3 access or performance issues?
Answer:
•	Check IAM permissions, bucket policies, and encryption settings.
Real-World Scenario: A customer reports slow performance when listing objects in an S3 bucket with millions of files. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Review S3 Access Logs and confirm API request patterns.
2.	Recommend using S3 Object Prefixes to improve parallelism.
3.	Suggest using S3 Inventory or Amazon S3 Select for faster data access.

Q4: What are typical EC2 troubleshooting steps?
Answer:
•	Diagnose issues using CloudWatch Metrics, system logs, and networking tools.
Real-World Scenario: An EC2 instance cannot connect to the internet after a recent VPC migration. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Check the route table for proper association with the internet gateway.
2.	Ensure the security group allows outbound traffic on required ports.
3.	Verify that the instance has a public IP assigned or configure a NAT gateway.
________________________________________
Q5: How does X-Ray help in debugging applications?
Answer:
•	Pinpoint bottlenecks in distributed systems with traces and service maps.
Real-World Scenario: A customer reports that their API Gateway + Lambda architecture is experiencing high latency. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Enable X-Ray on API Gateway and Lambda to trace request flow.
2.	Identify a slow database query causing delays.
3.	Recommend caching the query results using DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) or ElastiCache.
________________________________________
Q6: What are common Secrets Manager issues?
Answer:
•	Address access denials, secret rotation failures, or retrieval problems.
Real-World Scenario: A secret rotation fails after a recent update to the associated database password. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Review the Lambda function logs responsible for secret rotation.
2.	Verify that the new password matches the database's credentials.
3.	Ensure the Lambda function’s role has the necessary permissions to update the secret.

Q7: How do engineers resolve Route 53 DNS issues?
Answer:
•	Validate hosted zones, routing policies, and health checks.
Real-World Scenario: A customer’s website is unreachable after migrating DNS to Route 53. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Confirm that the NS records in the registrar’s settings point to Route 53.
2.	Check the hosted zone’s records (A/AAAA) for correctness.
3.	Test DNS resolution using dig or nslookup to ensure propagation.
________________________________________
Q8: What tools are used for proactive monitoring?
Answer:
•	CloudWatch, AWS Config, and Trusted Advisor.
Real-World Scenario: A customer wants to proactively monitor RDS storage utilization. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Set up a CloudWatch Alarm to trigger when storage usage exceeds 80%.
2.	Recommend enabling automatic storage scaling for the RDS instance.
________________________________________
Q9: How do you leverage CloudTrail for security investigations?
Answer:
•	Analyze API call history to track unauthorized actions.
Real-World Scenario: A customer suspects unauthorized access to an S3 bucket. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Review CloudTrail logs for PutBucketPolicy or GetObject events.
2.	Identify the IAM user or role making the suspicious calls.
3.	Suggest implementing bucket policies and MFA for additional security.
________________________________________
Q10: What are key use cases for AWS Config?
Answer:
•	Compliance checks, resource inventory, and drift detection.
Real World Scenario: A customer wants to enforce encryption on all EBS volumes. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Enable an AWS Config Rule to check if encryption is enabled.
2.	Flag non-compliant resources and suggest enabling default encryption for EBS.
________________________________________
Q11: How does Trusted Advisor improve operations?
Answer:
•	Optimize costs, security, fault tolerance, and performance.
Real-World Scenario: A customer receives alerts about overly permissive IAM roles. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Use Trusted Advisor to identify roles with * permissions.
2.	Suggest implementing least privilege policies.
________________________________________
Q12: How do Support Engineers handle CloudWatch Alarms?
Answer:
•	Monitor and respond to performance thresholds or errors.
Real-World Scenario: A customer’s EC2 instance is terminating repeatedly due to high CPU usage. Troubleshooting Steps:
1.	Review CloudWatch Alarms for CPU thresholds.
2.	Check application logs for processes causing spikes.
3.	Scale the instance or distribute workloads across multiple instances.
